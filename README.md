### Setup ###

These are my dotfiles. Just clone and symlink and you should be fairly good to go! Other minor-ish notes...

* For best colors, use the iTerm2 nightly builds.
* Import the `base16-custom.itermcolors` file into iTerm2.
* Add the `davidsantoso.zsh-theme` to the oh-my-zsh theme directory
* Symlink `vim` directory to `.vim` in $HOME
