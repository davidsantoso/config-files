### Setup ###

These are my dotfiles. Just clone and symlink and you should be fairly good to go! Other minor-ish notes...

* For best colors, use the iTerm2 nightly builds.
* Import the `base16-custom.itermcolors` file into iTerm2.
* Load up iTerm2 settings from `com.googlecode.iterm2.plist`
* Install oh-my-zsh
* Symlink the `.zshrc` to $HOME.
* Add the `davidsantoso.zsh-theme` to the oh-my-zsh theme directory.
* Symlink `.vimrc` to $HOME.
* Copy `vim/colors/base16-custom.vim` to $HOME.
