### Setup ###

These are my dotfiles. Just clone and symlink and you should be fairly good to go! Other minor-ish notes...

* For best colors, use the iTerm2 nightly builds.
* Import the `base16-custom.itermcolors` file into iTerm2.
* Load up iTerm2 settings from `com.googlecode.iterm2.plist`.
* Add the `davidsantoso.zsh-theme` to the oh-my-zsh theme directory.
* Symlink `vim` directory to `.vim` in $HOME.
* Symlink the `.zshrc` file in $HOME.
